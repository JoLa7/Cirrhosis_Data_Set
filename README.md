Liver disease affects over 100 million people in the US, with cirrhosis being a major cause of liver transplants. Our project examines Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease more prevalent in women. Studying PBC helps identify crucial factors in disease progression and treatment, aiding in better therapeutic interventions.
