# Cirrhosis_Data_Set
Liver disease affects over 100 million people in the US, with cirrhosis being a major cause of liver transplants. Our project examines Primary Biliary Cirrhosis, an autoimmune disease more prevalent in women. Studying PBC helps identify crucial factors in disease progression and treatment, aiding in better therapeutic interventions.

The data set was obtained from Open ML:

# Workflow
All data was cleaned in the latest version of R.

The model creation was done using SAS on Demand for Academics

# Reading in data

To read in the data, you must change the file path. For example in R the way I read in the data was by:
cir = read.csv("C:\\Users\\lazar\\Downloads\\cirrhosis.csv")

You need to change your file path to find where your data is at. 

The same applies when using SAS on Demand.
